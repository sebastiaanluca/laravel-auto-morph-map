**Decouple your internal application namespace structure from your database by automatically aliasing and mapping your Eloquent models as short, uniform class names instead of full class namespaces.**

> By default, Laravel will use the fully qualified class name to store the type of the related model. For instance, given the example above where a `Comment` may belong to a `Post` or a `Video`, the default `commentable_type` would be either `App\Post` or `App\Video`, respectively. However, you may wish to decouple your database from your application's internal structure. In that case, you may define a relationship "morph map" to instruct Eloquent to use a custom name for each model instead of the class name.

See [Custom Polymorphic Types](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/eloquent-relationships#polymorphic-relations) in the Laravel documentation for more information.

*Laravel auto morph map* improves upon that by scanning all your Eloquent models, automatically aliasing them as *uniform singular table names*, and registering them as a polymorphic type. No more need for dozens of manual `Relation::morphMap()` calls to register model morph types and no need to maintain that pesky morph map list when you add, change, or remove a model.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.3 or higher
- Laravel 7.0 or higher

## How to install

Via Composer:

```bash
composer require sebastiaanluca/laravel-auto-morph-map
```

## How to use

After installing this package, you're immediately good to go! The package will scan all your models and automatically register their polymorphic types on-the-fly.

Besides scanning and aliasing your models for you, this package alters no native Laravel functionality. Therefore, see the Laravel documentation on how to use [custom polymorphic types](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/eloquent-relationships#polymorphic-relations).

If you wish to customize some behavior, read further.

### Defining model namespaces

*Laravel auto morph map* uses your `composer.json` PSR-4 autoload section to know which namespaces and paths to scan. In any new Laravel project, the default `App\\` namespace is already in place, so for most projects no additional setup required. If you have other namespaces registered like local modules or (dev) packages, those will be scanned too.

```json
{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\": "app/",
            "MyModule\\": "modules/MyModule/",
            "MyPackage\\": "MyPackage/src/"
        }
    }
}
```

Furthermore it filters out traits, abstract classes, helper files, and other unusable items to only bind valid Eloquent models.

### Overriding existing aliases

If you wish, you can still override already aliased morph types in your service provider's `boot` method like you would normally:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Relation;

Relation::morphMap([
    'posts' => \App\Post::class,
    'videos' => \App\Video::class,
]);
```

These will always have priority over the already defined ones.

### Caching morph types in production

To cache all aliases and speed up your application in production, add the cache command to your deploy scripts:

```
php artisan morphmap:cache
```

This scans all your current models and writes a static cache file to the `bootstrap/cache` directory. Upon subsequent framework booting, it reads the cache file instead of scanning and aliasing on-the-fly.

Note that this thus **disables runtime scanning**, meaning new models will not be recognized and changes to existing models will not be reflected (not very handy during development).

To clear the cache file, run:

```
php artisan morphmap:clear
```

### Configuration

Run

```
php artisan vendor:publish
```

and select 

```
laravel-auto-morph-map (configuration)
```

to publish the configuration file.

#### Naming

The naming scheme to use when determining the model's morph type base value. Defaults to the singular table name (automatically determined by Laravel or overridden in the model using the `$table` variable).

You can change this to use the singular table name, table name, or class basename. See `\SebastiaanLuca\AutoMorphMap\Constants\NamingSchemes` for possible options.

Singular table name (default):

```php
Relation::morphMap([
    'collection_item' => 'App\CollectionItem',
]);
```

Table name:

```php
Relation::morphMap([
    'collection_items' => 'App\CollectionItem',
]);
```

Class basename:

```php
Relation::morphMap([
    'CollectionItem' => 'App\CollectionItem',
]);
```

#### Casing

Converts your model name (after having passed the naming scheme conversion) to a more uniform string. By default, the model's name (based on your naming scheme) is converted to *snake case*.

You can change this to use snake, slug, camel, studly or no casing. See `\SebastiaanLuca\AutoMorphMap\Constants\CaseTypes` for possible options.

Snake case (default):

```php
Relation::morphMap([
    'collection_item' => 'App\CollectionItem',
]);
```

Slug case:

```php
Relation::morphMap([
    'collection-item' => 'App\CollectionItem',
]);
```

Camel case:

```php
Relation::morphMap([
    'collectionItem' => 'App\CollectionItem',
]);
```

Studly case:

```php
Relation::morphMap([
    'CollectionItem' => 'App\CollectionItem',
]);
```

None (determined by your naming scheme and Laravel's class-to-table conversion method):

```php
Relation::morphMap([
    'collection_item' => 'App\CollectionItem',
]);
```
